<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Previous studies have established that the viscosity of low-grade
molasses and massecuites depends on the shear rate, temperature and
composition.  It has also been hinted that these fluids are not merely
viscous but rather viscoelastic.  This result is not unexpected, given
the presence of dissolved high polymers (polysaccharides).  After a
brief general discussion of fluid rheology, the present paper
describes an experiment performed on Queensland low-grade molasses to
exhibit its viscoelasticity.  When forced from a pipe, viscoelastic
fluids swell markedly.  A photograph of such an event is presented
here and also used to estimate the fluid's viscoelastic relaxation
time.  The result, about a tenth of a second, is consistent with the
values determined for French beet molasses by <a
href = "#deviP71">Devillers and Ph&eacute;lizot (1971)</a> using a
Weissenberg rheogoniometer.  The estimated relaxation time is used to
assess the possible impact of viscoelasticity in two factory
processes: stirring in cooling crystallizers and flow through pipe
fittings.  It is concluded that viscoelasticity may play a role in the
known tendency of low-grade massecuites to short-circuit in vessels of
complex geometry and also may explain the anomalous published
pressure-drop data for molasses flow in pipe-fittings.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It is well established that low-grade massecuites and molasses are
rheologically complex fluids and that knowledge of their flow
properties is important for the design, control and understanding of
factory processes.  Numerous studies have quantified the effects of
temperature, composition and the shear rate on the viscosity of
Queensland massecuites and molasses (e.g.  <a href = "#behn64">Behne,
1964</a>; <a href="#bhatBHT72">Bhattacharyya <em>et al.,</em>
1972</a>; <a href="#awanW76">Awang and White, 1976</a>).  However,
there has also been speculation that these materials are not purely
viscous, but rather viscoelastic (<a href="#ness84">Ness,
1984</a>). This is, indeed, to be expected, since the principal factor
rendering these fluids non-Newtonian, and so distinguishing them from
Newtonian pure sugar solutions, is the presence of polysaccharides (<a
href="#geroG78">Geronimos and Greenfield, 1978</a>): components known
to induce both pseudoplasticity and elasticity (<a
href="#lapaP95">Lapasin and Pricl, 1995</a>).</p>

<p>Since being applied to the processing of Australian cane sugar five
years ago (<a href="#harrRV95">Harris <em>et al.,</em> 1995</a>; <a
href="#stei95">Steindl, 1995</a>), computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
has come to play an important role in the understanding of flow and
heat transfer in factory processes and in the assessment of
modifications to vessel designs (<a href="#stei97">Steindl, 1997</a>;
<a href="#simaH99">Sima and Harris, 1999</a>). The single greatest
strength of CFD is its ability to provide a local description of the
flow.  While dye or lithium tracer tests may be able to indicate the
presence of short-circuits or dead-spots, they do not indicate their
location.</p>

<p>The price which must be paid for this increase in local knowledge
is the provision of local material properties (<a href="#simaH97">Sima
and Harris, 1997</a>). Thus, while a simple parameter such as the
viscosity obtained from a one-dimensional shear flow, or `viscometric'
flow, is adequate and appropriate for use in the global modelling of a
vessel, it cannot be assumed that the behaviour of a fluid in a two-
or three-dimensional flow can be predicted on the basis of
observations of one-dimensional flows (<a href="#true74">Truesdell,
1974</a>). It is the special property of Newtonian fluids that this
simplification is possible for them; the uncritical extension of this
simplification to non-Newtonian fluids is at best an expedient (<a
href="#birdSL60">Bird <em>et al.,</em> 1960</a>, p. 103; <a
href="#fred64">Fredrickson, 1964</a>, p. 86; <a href="#tann88">Tanner,
1988</a>, p. 131). The purpose of this paper is to determine, on the
basis of simple and readily repeatable measurements, the extent to
which this simplification may be acceptable for low-grade
molasses.</p>

<p>If present, viscoelasticity manifests itself in all unsteady flows
as well as in steady flows in complex geometries (as occur in
continuous factory vessels) but cannot be detected by the usual
measurements of steady viscometric flows such as occur in pipeline or
concentric-cylinder viscometers; except for the empirical fact that
all known shear-thinning fluids are also appreciably viscoelastic (<a
href="#fred64">Fredrickson, 1964</a>, p. 70). Elastic effects are more
marked when the fluid is subjected to more rapid changes; this
rapidity, and thus the importance of viscoelasticity, for a given
fluid in a given flow can be quantified by the dimensionless
<em>Deborah number De</em>, as defined and discussed below.</p>

<p>Two phenomena peculiar to elastic fluids are stress relaxation and
jet-swell (the dramatic and readily observable increase in diameter of
a viscoelastic stream leaving a pipe). Using the former, and a
Weissenberg rheogoniometer, <a href="#deviP71">Devillers and
Ph&eacute;lizot (1971)</a> determined the viscoelastic properties of
beet molasses. In this paper, we report new experiments on the
jet-swell of low-grade Queensland molasses which indicate comparable
elastic properties. From the results we estimate Deborah numbers for
various flows occurring in sugar factories and so assess where elastic
effects may be most significant.</p>

<h2>Viscoelastic liquids</h2>

<p>The Deborah number quantifies the difference between the
deformation behaviour of (elastic) solids and (viscous) liquids. We
give an elementary explanation, following <a href="#lapaP95">Lapasin
and Pricl</a> (1995, p. 164). The Deborah number is defined as the
ratio between a characteristic relaxation time, &#955;, of the
material and a characteristic residence time of the deformation
process under observation. The relaxation time is zero for an
inelastic viscous fluid and infinite for a elastic solid. The
rheological properties of a substance can be easily classified as
liquid-like when the relaxation time is much shorter than the
residence time and as solid-like when it is much longer. In other
words, high Deborah numbers correspond to solid-like behaviour and low
Deborah numbers to liquid-like behaviour. In the intermediate region,
materials may display a combination of both properties and their
behaviour is called <em>viscoelastic.</em> Material relaxation times
range from picoseconds for water or atmospheric air and nanoseconds
for mineral oils through microseconds to kiloseconds for various
polymer solutions and melts to megaseconds for glass (<a
href="#tann88">Tanner, 1988</a>, p. 22).</p>

<p>Mathematically, the difference between Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids
lies in their constitutive relation: the relation between the stress
<strong>s</strong> and the rate of deformation <strong>d</strong>. For a
Newtonian liquid,</p>

<p align="right"><img src = "Image1.gif"
alt="$\mathbf{s}=\eta\mathbf{d}$" width="45" height="21" /> <a
name = "eqn1">(1)</a></p>

<p align="right"></p>

<p>where &#951; is the viscosity. The viscosity will in general depend
on pressure, temperature and composition. If it also depends on the
deformation rate, but <a href="#eqn1">(1)</a> otherwise holds, then we
have a <em>generalized Newtonian fluid</em> (<a
href="#lapaP95">Lapasin and Pricl, 1995</a>, p. 216). The simplest
model of a generalized Newtonian fluid is the <em>power-law</em>
model, for which <img src="Image2.gif"
alt="$\eta=K|\mathbf{n}|^{(1-n)}$" width = "80" height = "29" />,
where <em>K</em> is the <em>consistency</em> and <em>n</em> is the
<em>flow behaviour index.</em> If <img src="Image3.gif"
alt="$0&lt;\eta&lt;1$" width = "60" height = "21"/>, the fluid is said
to be <em>pseudoplastic</em> or <em>shear-thinning.</em></p>

<p>For a viscoelastic fluid, the stress depends not only on the
instantaneous rate of deformation, but also on the entire history of
the deformation. Many different forms of constitutive equations for
viscoelastic liquids are discussed by <a href="#lars88">Larson
(1988)</a>. Their common feature is that the liquid has a fading
memory of past configurations; the time-scale for the fading of the
memory is the relaxation time. They all reduce to the Newtonian form
<a href="#eqn1">(1)</a> when the Deborah number becomes vanishingly small.</p>

<h3>Viscoelasticity and stress relaxation</h3>

<p>A simple consequence of the fading memory of a viscoelastic fluid
is that if it is subjected to a steady shearing and then this ceases,
the associated stress does not immediately disappear, but rather
decays. <a href="#deviP71">Devillers and Ph&eacute;lizot (1971)</a>
measured the stress as a function of time in 12 beet molasses samples
after bringing a spinning cone-and-plate viscometer to a halt, and
calculated the relaxation time by fitting an exponential decay
function to the results. The resulting relaxation times were in the
range 0.05-0.2 s. This technique is capable of high accuracy.</p>

<h3>Viscoelasticity and jet-swell</h3>

<p>Another feature of the flow of viscoelastic liquids is the
expansion of jets. Depending on the liquid and the flow rate, it can
be quite strikingsee the photographs by <a href="#merr43">Merrington
(1943)</a> or <a href="#tann88">Tanner</a> (1988, p. 306). This
phenomenon is of great importance in the plastics industry,
particularly in the spinning of synthetic fibres (<a
href="#tann88">Tanner, 1988</a>, p. 282) and blow molding (<a
href="#eggeH96">Eggen and Hinrichsen, 1996</a>).</p>

<p>When a Newtonian liquid leaves a pipe, it usually contracts slightly. This
effect, which is easily demonstrated with a kitchen tap, is due to inertia; in
this case, the fluid which was previously slowed by contact with the pipe
walls simply adopts the speed of the more freely flowing fluid on the
centreline. If the fluid is very viscous (so that inertia becomes negligible)
but still Newtonian, the jet will expand by about 13%; here the small change
is caused by the rearrangement of the velocity field from the parabolic
profile inside the pipe to the plug flow in the free jet.</p>

<p>For pseudoplastic generalized Newtonian fluids, the swelling is
less than for Newtonian fluids; it decreases to zero with the flow
behaviour index <em>n</em> (<a href="#tann88">Tanner, 1988</a>,
p. 327). This result is known only from computer simulations; there
being no known inelastic pseudoplastic fluids. It occurs because the
velocity profile in the pipe flow of a pseudoplastic fluid is closer
to plug flow than the parabolic profile of a Newtonian fluid, so that
less adjustment is required from the pipe to the jet.</p>

<p>Marked swelling is a characteristic of viscoelasticity. To see why a fading
memory causes jet-swell, consider a pair of fluid elements in a pipe flow 
(<a href="#fig_explained">see figure 1</a>). 
The element nearer the axis flows faster, so that at any given
time, the pair are further apart in the axial direction than they were in the
past. When they leave the pipe, the shear caused by the no-slip condition at
the pipe wall ceases, and the pair are free to return to their remembered
configuration. This causes an axial contraction and so a lateral expansion (in
order for the jet to have the same flow rate as the pipe). The longer the
memory of the fluid (the longer the relaxation time), the greater the axial
and lateral recoil.</p>

<p>Figure 1: An explanation for the swelling of viscoelastic jets. The
fluid-particle pair AB becomes elongated in the axial direction due to
shear.  On exiting, it reverts toward its remembered shape.</p>

<p>By expressing the above argument in the language of tensor
analysis, and assuming a particular simple constitutive equation known
as the Lodge equation (<a href="#lars88">Larson, 1988</a>, p. 23), <a
href="#tann70">Tanner (1970)</a> developed a theory of jet-swell which
allows the prediction of the <em>swelling ratio D</em>/<em>d</em>
(where <em>D</em> is the jet diameter and <em>d</em> is the pipe
diameter) from the dimensionless <em>Weissenberg number Wi</em>, the
product of the shear rate at the pipe wall <img src="Image4.gif"
alt="$\dot{\gamma}_w$" width="20" height="24" /> and the relaxation time
of the fluid &#955;. The resulting relation,</p>

<h2>Apparatus and method</h2>

<p>A swelling jet of low-grade molasses can be generated by forcing it
through the outlet pipe of a <em>pressure filter.</em> This simple
piston device is more usually employed to separate molasses from
massecuite. The only modification to the device for the tests was to
fit a new copper molasses outlet pipe. For filtration, the outlet is
of little interest, but it is known that jet-swell can be affected by
the length-to-diameter ratio of the pipe unless it is very long: in a
short pipe, a viscoelastic fluid can remember the conditions upstream
of the inlet (<a href="#seriGC93">Seriai <em>et al.,</em>
1993</a>). Guided by Seriai's results and the recommendation of <a
href="#binnB81">Binnington and Boger (1981)</a>, a length-to-diameter
ratio of 20 was chosen.  The pipe was straight and vertical (downward)
for the last 145 mm before the outlet and the internal diameter of the
pipe was 7.2 mm.</p>

<p>A sample of C-massecuite was obtained from downstream of the exit pump of
the vertical cooling crystallizer at Victoria Mill. The massecuite was passed
through the pressure filter and the molasses collected. After cleaning the
filter and removing the gauze, the molasses was passed through again. Once a
steady jet was being produced, a measuring beaker was placed in the stream and
a stopwatch started. After an easily measurable amount had been collected but
before the jet flow rate declined significantly (the pressure filter is a
batch device), the beaker was removed, the timer stopped, and the temperature
of the extrudate measured with a mercury-in-glass thermometer. Digital
photographs were taken throughout the operation, from which the diameter of
the jet could be compared with the external diameter of the pipe (9.2 mm).</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>A photograph taken soon after the establishment of steady-state is
shown in <a href="#fig_photo">figure 3</a>.  It is clear from the
photograph (<a href="#fig_photo">figure 3</a>) that gravity did have
an effect on jet: it becomes increasingly thin as the molasses is
drawn down by its weight. The effect is less important in the
immediate vicinity of the outlet. The diameter considered here is the
maximum; this will be slightly less than would occur in the absence of
gravity and so will lead to an underestimate of the swelling and hence
the relaxation time and the elasticity. Thus, while gravity (and
surface tension which also acts to reduce the jet diameter-<a
href="#tann88">Tanner, 1988</a>, p. 323) does reduce the quantitative
accuracy of our results, it does not detract from our primary
contention that low-grade molasses is viscoelastic.</p>

<p class="figure"><img name="fig_photo" src = "photo.jpeg"
alt="photo.jpeg" /><br />Figure 3.  Jet-swell observed in flow of
low-grade molasses.</p>

<p>In the photograph shown, the maximum jet diameter is 11 mm, which
equates to a swelling ratio of <img src="Image6.gif" alt="$D/d=1.53$"
width="80" height="18" />. This value may be compared with the 1.13
expected for a Newtonian fluid.  From Tanner's formula <a
href="#eqn2">(2)</a> or <a href="#fig_dieswell">figure 2</a>, <img
src="Image7.gif" alt="$D/d=1.53$" width="80" height="18" /> implies <img
src="Image8.gif" alt="$Wi=3.64$" width="66" height="18" />. In the same
run, 180 mL of molasses were extruded in 210 s. From this flow rate
and assuming a parabolic velocity profile in the pipe (accounting for
shear-thinning would give a different value, but, again, neglecting it
only leads to an underestimate of the relaxation time) the wall shear
rate is <img src="Image9.gif"
alt="$\dot{\gamma}_w=37.8\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$" width="82"
height="25" />. Hence, the relaxation time is <img src="Image10.gif" alt="$\lambda = Wi/\dot{\gamma}_w = 3.64/(37.8\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 0.096\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$"
width="253" height="25" />.  From the other photographs in the series,
it was apparent that the swelling reduced slightly with time; a
consequence of a slow decay in the flow rate.  The swelling ratio fell
to about 1.32 over the course of the 210 s, which would correspond to
an estimated relaxation time of 0.078 s.  Thus, to an appropriate
level of accuracy, the relaxation time may be stated as about a tenth
of a second, a value quite consistent with those determined by <a
href="#deviP71">Devillers and Ph&eacute;lizot (1971)</a> for beet
molasses. The temperature of the extrudate was 50&plusmn;5&deg;C.
Standard methods of analysis revealed the molasses to be a fairly
normal low-grade specimen: the dry substance was 86.4% and the purity
45.8%.  The original massecuite was 91% dry substance and about 68%
purity.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a single measurement is not sufficient to
quantitatively determine the relaxation time, but that is not the
purpose of the present paper. Indeed, although the ease of observation
and measurement have tempted many investigators to try and base a
rheometrical method on jet-swell, various difficulties including the
effect of gravity and nonlinearities in the constitutive equation (<a
href="#binnB81">Binnington and Boger, 1981</a>) have meant that an
adequate jet-swell model remains elusive. More precise techniques are
discussed by <a href="#lapaP95">Lapasin and Pricl</a> (1995,
pp. 423-435, ch. 5). The present determination, supported to some
extent by the results for beet molasses, should, however, be
sufficient for order-of-magnitude analyses. Two examples are provided
in the next section.</p>

<h2>Application of the results</h2>

<h3>Stirring in a vertical cooling crystallizer</h3>

<p>The strongest deformation in a vertical cooling crystallizer, for
example the one installed at Victoria Mill (described by <a
href="#simaH97">Sima and Harris, 1997</a>), is due to the passage of
the stirrer arms at their ends.  To assess the importance of
viscoelasticity in this flow, we calculate the Deborah number,
assuming the figure of 0.1 s for the massecuite relaxation time (what
effect the crystals might have on the elasticity is unclear at this
stage).  To obtain a characteristic time for the deformation process,
consider the time taken for the end of one of the stirrer arms to pass
through a given point; i.e. its diameter divided by its linear
velocity.  According to <a href="#robi94">Robinson</a> (1994, p. 72),
the stirrer arms are 143 mm in diameter, 1794 mm long and rotate at
0.3 rpm, hence the linear speed of the end is 56 mm/s and the time of
traverse is 2.5 s.  This gives a Deborah number of <img
src="Image11.gif" alt="$0.1\,\mathrm{s}/2.5\,\mathrm{s} = 0.04$"
width="112" height="21" />.  This is small compared to unity, but the
question now is whether it is so small that viscoelastic effects will
be negligible.</p>

<p><a href="#cochWW81">Cochrane <em>et al.</em> (1981)</a> presented
streak-line photographs of the flow of a Newtonian and a viscoelastic
fluid over a cylinder set slightly off-centre in a channel.  The
Deborah numbers were zero and 0.17, respectively.  At zero Deborah
number the asymmetry is barely discernible whereas it is exaggerated
at 0.17.  It is impossible to provide a definitive statement in the
absence of results at intermediate Deborah numbers, but we conjecture
that while elastic effects might be measurable in the vertical cooling
crystallizer, they are probably not dominant.</p>

<p>One conclusion of <a href="#cochWW81">Cochrane <em>et al.</em>
(1981)</a> may be significant, however.  After examining a number of
flow configurations, they found symmetry to be an elusive feature in
the flow of highly elastic liquids.  Perhaps the viscoelasticity of
low-grade cane sugar solutions contributes to their tendency to
short-circuit in process vessels of complex internal geometry <a
href="#keasS84">(Keast and Sichter, 1984)</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a molasses has a tendency to avoid narrow flow passages, due
to the presence of a viscoelasticity-inducing component, it will very likely
be more difficult to fugal.  Successful separation involves the migration of
the molasses through the pores of the packed bed of sugar crystals adjacent
the wire-mesh basket and the holes of the basket itself.  A more elastic
molasses would be more inclined to travel with the bulk motion of the
crystals.  Thus, viscoelasticity may be an important parameter in the
separability of low-grade massecuites by centrifugation.</p>

<h3>Flow around pipe bends</h3>

<p>While liquid elasticity is not important for flow inside straight pipes, it
may have an effect on flow around bends.  A characteristic deformation time to
use in the Deborah number can be obtained from the time to traverse one radian
of the bend at the mean flow speed <i>V</i>:</p>

<p align="right"><img src="Image12.gif" alt="$De=\frac{\lambda V}{R}$"
width="64" height="41" /> <a name = "eqn3">(3)</a></p>

<p align="right">where <i>R</i> is the radius of the bend.  If, for
simplicity, the effect of pseudoplasticity is neglected, the Reynolds
number is given by <img src="Image13.gif" alt="$Re=2\rho Vr/\eta$" width="90"
height="22" />, where <i>r</i> is the pipe radius and &rho; is
the density. Both <i>Re</i> and <i>De</i> can be considered as
dimensionless speeds; they are related by</p>

<p align="right"><img src="Image14.gif" alt="$De =
\frac{\lambda\eta}{2r^2/rho} = \frac{Re}{R/r}$" width="109"
height="45" /> <a name="eqn4">(4)</a></p>

<p>A tighter bend (smaller <i>R</i>/<i>r</i>) corresponds to a more rapid
deformation and a higher Deborah number.</p>

<p><a href="#bojcKB97">Bojcic <em>et al.</em> (1997)</a> published
experimental friction factors for the flow of molasses in various pipe
fittings. A remarkable feature of the results was a discontinuity in
the friction factor at a certain critical Reynolds number. The data
for the four fittings examined by <a href="#bojcKB97">Bojcic <em>et
al.</em> (1997)</a> are listed in <a href="#table">table 1</a>. The
last column contains our estimate of the corresponding critical
Deborah number, assuming the following material properties: <img
src="Image15.gif" alt="$\lambda = 0.1\,\mathrm{s}$" width="57"
height="21" />, <img src="Image16.gif" alt="$\eta = 20 \mathrm{Pa.s}$"
width="74" height="21" />, <img src="Image17.gif" alt="$\rho =
1500\,\mathrm{kg/m}^3$" width="104" height="24" />; the pipe radius was
10 mm.</p>

<p>Thus for the two 90&deg; bends (T-90 was a tee-joint) we see that the
critical Deborah numbers are very much closer (within 10%) than the
corresponding critical Reynolds numbers (within 80%). The fact that all the
estimated critical Deborah numbers are of the order of magnitude of
10<sup>-1</sup> is consistent with the interpretation of the Deborah number as
the ratio of elastic to viscous forces; it is at such Deborah numbers that the
first signs of viscoelasticity might be expected. Of course, a more detailed
investigation into the flow around pipe bends would be required to determine
the contributions of inertia (<i>Re</i>) and viscoelasticity (<i>De</i>); this
could involve either CFD or comparison with data from fluids known to be
Newtonian.</p>

<h2>Assessment and conclusions</h2>

<p>We have clearly demonstrated that low-grade molasses is
viscoelastic. Our preliminary estimate of the relaxation time for the
sample studied is about one tenth of a second at 50&deg;C, a value
which is consistent with those found for beet molasses by <a
href="#deviP71">Devillers and Ph&eacute;lizot (1971)</a>. This value would
suggest that viscoelastic effects are probably not dominant in such
vessels as vertical cooling crystallizers, where the typical residence
time for any particular segment is at least of the order of
seconds. More detailed and quantitative rheometry is indicated,
particularly if future factory measurements show deviations from
computer predictions based on generalized Newtonian rheological
models.</p>
