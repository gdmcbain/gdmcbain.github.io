characterization of low-grade molasses by jet-swell measurements'</a></h1>

<h2><a name="ness84" id="ness84" href="jet.html#ness84">Ness (1984)</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. R. J. McLEAN asked if viscosity measurements using the
pipeline viscometer were valid for heavy, low purity massecuites.</p>

<p>DR. NESS replied that heavy, low purity massecuites tended to show
viscoelastic properties, but these were only of interest when a change
of shear rate is forced on the material, e.g. start of pumping.  For
steady state operation the viscosity values determined the pipeline
method are valid for the design of factor pipework. [<em>at p. 101</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Of course, the simplification for steady state operation Ness
refers to does not apply to complex geometries.</em></p>

<p><em>Viscoelasticity is also referred to in the original paper
(J. N. Ness 1984, ASSCT)</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>under some processing conditions, e.g. presence of
dextrans and other high molecular weight polymers, and with very low
purity materials, other rheological phenomena such as elastic and time
dependent behaviour may become significant.  More elaborate
viscometers are needed to quantify these phenomena, and Devillers and
Ph&eacute;lizot (1971) report some measurements on viscoelasticity in
molasses using a Weissenberg rheogoniometer.  Apart from that study
these aspects of molasses and massecuite rheology have received little
attention. [<em>at p. 275</em>]</p></blockquote>

Stewart &amp; Lightfoot (1960)</a></h2>

<p><em>In the section `The equations of change for incompressible
non-Newtonian flow':</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only thing we have done here [<em>in writing the power-law
model in tensor form, for use in a general equation of motion</em>] is
to write the expressions in such a way that they transform properly in
going from one coordinate system to another.  Otherwise, we could not
be assured that the parameters---[<em>consistency</em>] and [<em>flow
behaviour index</em>], for example---would be the same when determined
in various geometrical arrangements.  ...Furthermore, we have
restricted the discussion even more be the assumption that Eq. 3.6.-2
[<b>&#964;</b>=-<i>&#951;</i><b>&#916;</b>] can be used to describe
non-Newtonian behaviour [<em>from p. 103</em>]</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="fred64" id="fred64" href="jet.html#fred64">Fredrickson
(1964)</a></h2>

<blockquote><p>if one desires only a partial solution to a problem and
is willing to accept the fact that his solutions may not give good
results, the [<em>rheological</em>] equation of state </p>

<p><i>p<sup>ij</sup>=&#945;(Y)e<sup>*ij</sup>, </i>(4.78)</p>

<p><i>Y=&frac12;e<sup>*n</sup><sub>m</sub>
e<sup>*m</sup><sub>n</sub></i>
(4.79)</p>

<p>[<em>i.e. the generalized Newtonian model</em>] may be used for
incompressible fluids.  In Chapter 7 we shall show that Eq. (4.78) may
be used for the steady flow of viscoelastic fluids. [<em>from
p. 86</em>]</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Fredrickson here uses steadiness in a different
sense than is usual: each particle must experience an unchanging
stress state, rather than the velocity at a point remaining the
same, cf. the following excerpt from a discussion of boundary layer
flow on p. 247:</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Since the strain rate seen by a moving particle in the
situation considered [<em>viz. boundary layer flow</em>] <b>changes with
time</b>, it is clear that any viscoelasticity <b>must</b> be
manifested in some fashion</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Other quotations from Fredrickson's book:</em></p>

<blockquote><p>it was shown that the Reiner&mdash;Rivlin equations for
a purely viscous fluid predict a type of Weissenberg effect...so
that the effect [<em>viz. rod-climbing</em>] is not associated only with
viscoelastic fluids.  However, all fluids which yield Weissenberg
effects are also viscoelastic, so that one is probably not wrong in
associating the effect primarily with viscoelasticity [<em>at
p. 122</em>]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As a matter of fact, the experimental evidence
indicates that there are no Stokesian fluids, save those which are
also Newtonian [<em>at p. 70.</em>]</p></blockquote>

<p><em>A Stokesian fluid is a purely viscous fluid which is isotropic;
i.e. a fluid for which the stress tensor is an (isotropic) function of
the rate-of-strain tensor (but not the history of the rate-of-strain
tensor).  This includes all generalized Newtonian fluids, for which
the stress tensor is just half the rate-of-strain tensor times a
scalar field called the viscosity (which may depend on the scalar
invariants of the rate-of-strain or stress tensors).  The power-law
fluid is then a very special case of the Stokesian
model.</em></p>

(1981)</a></h2>

<blockquote><p>The final geometry in the present study involves
channel flow that is disturbed by a cylindrical obstacle (see figure 2
<i>f</i>).  The obstacle is in a slightly asymmetric position with
respect to the channel.  For the Newtonian liquid (figure 17 <i>a</i>,
plate 13) the asymmetry in the streamlines is barely discernible to
the naked eye (if at all) whereas the asymmetry is
<em>exaggerated</em> for the elastic liquid (figures 17 <i>b, c</i>).
This is yet another dramatic demonstration of the differences in flow
characteristics found in Newtonian and elastic liquids.  It supports
our conclusion in regard to combined mixing and separating flow that
symmetry is elusive for elastic liquids whenever there is a mechanism
in the flow for promoting an asymmetry of any degree. [<em>at
p. 170</em>]</p></blockquote> 

<h2><a name="tann88" id="tann88" href="jet.html#tann88">Tanner (1988)</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of the failure [<em>of the Stokesian,
a.k.a. Reiner&mdash;Rivlin, constitutive equation,
<i>&#963;<sub>ij</sub> = -p&#948;<sub>ij</sub> + 2&#951;d<sub>ij</sub>
+ 4&#957;<sub>2</sub>d<sub>ik</sub>d<sub>kj</sub></i>, where
<i>&#951;</i> and <i>&#957<sub>2</sub></i> are functions of the second
and third invariants of <i>d<sub>ij</sub></i></em>] to model the dominant
normal stress difference, it is not possible to use this equation in
any flow where this factor is important.  It is also not a realistic
description of the transient response of polymer fluids since when
motion ceases <i>&#964;<sub>ij</sub></i> immediately vanishes which is
contrary to observation.  In fact, the only flow which is described
accurately by this equation is a steady elongational flow.  It is
nevertheless often used when the flow is dominated by a variable
viscosity.  The function <i>&#957;<sub>2</sub></i> [<em>the second
normal stress coefficient</em>] is then usually set equal to zero and
the viscosity taken as a function of the second invariant of
<i>d<sub>ij</sub></i> only.  One is then back to a simple
non-Newtonian fluid, often called a generalized Newtonian fluid, in
which the viscosity varies with the shear rate.  The only flows of
polymer fluids which are strictly suitable for modelling in this way
are those which are very close to steady viscometric; for slurries
where elastic effects are minimal it is more useful.  It would be
futile to attempt to catalogue all solutions to flow problems which
use this limited and atypical type of flow behaviour.  Most often the
viscosity function is described by a `power-law' behaviour...However,
it must be reiterated that the inelastic fluid model often omits
important phenomena, and hence it is not reasonable to devote great
efforts to the analytical solution of this system of equations.</p>
