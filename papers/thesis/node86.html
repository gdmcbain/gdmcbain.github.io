The floor and ceiling problems
</H1>

<P>
In the remainder of this chapter, the solution and postprocessing
method just developed is used to investigate the floor and ceiling problems.

<P>
The understanding of vapour transport across gas-filled enclosures has been
hampered by the large number of dimensionless parameters and possible flow
regimes.  Here, a conduction-diffusion regime is defined by the existence
of a fully developed region, for which an analytic solution is available
(ch.&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#ch:NCL">4</A>).  Numerical solutions demonstrating the existence of the
regime for a cavity of finite vertical aspect ratio are presented.  The
agreement between the numerical and analytic solutions gives mutual
validation.  The range of parameters over which the regime applies is
investigated, with emphasis on the penetration of end-effects into the core.
The functional dependence of the overall transfer rates on the vertical
aspect ratio is also presented.

<P>
First, let us review the relevant literature.

<P>
There have been several previous investigations of vapour transport across
gas-filled enclosures, as summarized in chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node33.html#ch:LR">3</A>.
These studies have produced various formulae for the heat and mass transfer
rates, but it is difficult to assess their domain of validity, given the
large number of dimensionless governing parameters
and the range of possible flow regimes, the principal
divisions amongst which arise from the existence of turbulence, multiple
cells and/or boundary layers.

<P>
A demarcation of regimes for strongly convective flows driven either
by heat (<IMG
 WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img433.png"
 ALT="$N=0$">) or mass (<IMG
 WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img659.png"
 ALT="$N^{-1}=0$">) transfer with vanishingly dilute
vapours (<IMG
 WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img297.png"
 ALT="$\varPhi =0$">) according to the relative magnitudes of the
Schmidt, <I>Sc</I>, and (reference) Prandtl, <!-- MATH
 $\mbox{\textit{Pr}}_r$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img55.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{\textit{Pr}}_r$">, numbers was made by
Bejan (1985;
&#167;<A HREF="node47.html#sec:LR_beja85">3.3.5</A>).  
These results were verified by B&#233;ghein et al. (1992;
&#167;<A HREF="node57.html#sec:LR_beghHA92">3.3.15</A>),
but only for values of <I>Sc</I> and
<!-- MATH
 $\mbox{\textit{Pr}}_r$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img55.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{\textit{Pr}}_r$"> much larger or smaller than unity.  Unfortunately, for
gas-vapour mixtures, the diffusivities of momentum, temperature and
species are all of similar order of magnitude.  Theoretically based
formulae for the heat and mass transfer rates have been developed 
that are valid for Prandtl and Schmidt numbers near, but not
necessarily equal to, unity  (McBain 1997<I>b</I>;
&#167;<A HREF="node58.html#sec:LR_mcba9597b">3.3.16</A>).
These latter formulae are based on a scale
analysis appropriate for boundary layer regimes, and so perform poorly
for flows where diffusive effects penetrate across the width of the
cavity.

<P>
In chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#ch:NCL">4</A>, an analytic solution of the system of
governing equations was presented that is valid in the narrow cavity limit,
<!-- MATH
 $\mbox{$\mathcal A$},\,\mbox{$\mathcal S$}\rightarrow\infty$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img660.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{$\mathcal A$},\,\mbox{$\mathcal S$}\rightarrow\infty$">.  This solution is
analogous to that of Jones and Furry (1946); 
i.e. equations (<A HREF="node66.html#soln:narrow_u_Phi0">4.35</A>)-(<A HREF="node66.html#soln:narrow_T_Phi0">4.38</A>)
with <IMG
 WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img579.png"
 ALT="$c=0$">; for the single fluid
heat transfer problem (defined in &#167;<A HREF="node27.html#sec:BE_Sfhtp">2.4</A>).
Thus, this new solution can be taken to define a 
`conduction-diffusion regime' for the nonisothermal vapour transport
problem, in the same way that Batchelor (1954) and Eckert and
Carlson (1961) 
defined a conduction regime for the heat transfer problem,
as that in which the one-dimensional profiles 
occur over at least some section of the height of the cavity.  
<A NAME="sec:CDR_defined"></A>
<P>
One of the present purposes is to demonstrate numerically that the
conduction-diffusion regime can exist in a two-dimensional cavity of
finite vertical aspect ratio.  Previously the only evidence was the qualitative
assertion of Jhaveri et al. (1981)
for a case of isothermal mass
transfer; <!-- MATH
 $N=\infty,\,\mbox{\textit{Gr}}=0,\,\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)=1.6,\,\mbox{\textit{Sc}}=1,\,\varPhi =-0.4$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="440" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img661.png"
 ALT="$N=\infty,\,\mbox{\textit{Gr}}=0,\,\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)=1.6,\,\mbox{\textit{Sc}}=1,\,\varPhi =-0.4$"> and 
<!-- MATH
 $\mbox{$\mathcal A$}=4$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img431.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{$\mathcal A$}=4$">; that the flow was essentially one-dimensional,
except adjacent to the horizontal walls.
Demonstrating the existence of the regime also simultaneously validates
the former analytic and present finite element solutions.  

<P>
A second desirable purpose would be to determine the range of the
dimensionless parameters for which the regime exists, but this is
difficult for two reasons.  Firstly, the large number of governing
parameters makes an exhaustive set of numerical experiments prohibitively
expensive; there are seven parameters in the present model
compared with three for the pure fluid problem: <I>Gr</I>, <I>Pr</I> and <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.png"
 ALT="$\mathcal A$">.  
Secondly, there may be several
mechanisms which can lead to the destruction of the regime.
According to Daniels (1985),
the pure fluid conduction regime can break down in three ways:

<UL>
<LI>travelling wave instability;
</LI>
<LI>stationary spanwise roll instability with vertical periodicity; or
</LI>
<LI>a gradual penetration of convective effects into the core from the
ends as the Grashof number increases.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The travelling wave instability, in the pure fluid case, occurs only for
large Prandtl numbers so that it should not be relevant for gas-vapour
mixtures.  The minimum Prandtl number is given as 11.4 by Gershuni and 
Zhukhovitskii (1976, p.&nbsp;276), and 12.7 by Bergholz (1978).

<P>
A proper consideration of the second mechanism
would require reference to the unsteady equations 
(Cleary 1995<I>a</I>);
the numerical model developed in &#167;&#167;<A HREF="node75.html#sec:FC_Mvtf">5.1</A> - <A HREF="node85.html#sec:FC_Cuf">5.3</A>
treats only the stationary forms of the equations.  
Linear stability analysis of the pure fluid problem predicts the appearance
multiple rolls if the Grashof number exceeds a critical value
weakly dependent on the Prandtl number.  It decreases from its
zero Prandtl number limit of 7932
(Korpela, G&#246;z&#252;m &amp; Baxi  1973) 
to 7349.516 at <!-- MATH

The discrepancy between the theoretical value, 8038, at <!-- MATH

 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img666.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{\textit{Pr}}=0.71$"> (Korpela et
al. 1973) and Hollands and Konicek's (1973) experimental value of 11 000
for air was ascribed by Lee and Korpela (1983) to the stabilizing effect of the
slight positive vertical temperature gradient resulting from the finite
vertical aspect ratio of the physical cavity.
In the absence of knowledge of the effect of <!-- MATH

 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img667.png"
 ALT="$\varPhi , N, \mbox{\textit{Pr}}_I$"> or <I>Sc</I> on the
critical Grashof number, the parameters for this study were chosen so that
the combined Grashof number, <!-- MATH
 $\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)$">, was considerably less than 8000.

<P>
Even if consideration is restricted to the third mechanism, the problem 
has not yet been solved conclusively even for pure heat transfer.
Some authors have asserted
that the conduction regime exists below a certain fixed Rayleigh number,
giving values between 1500 and 3000 (Vest &amp; Arpaci 1969; Dixon &amp; Probert
1975; Gebhart et al. 1988, p.&nbsp;730).  
The analyses of Batchelor (1954), Patterson and Imberger (1980),
 and Daniels (1985), on the other hand, suggest that the
maximum Rayleigh number is proportional to the vertical aspect ratio.  
The boundary drawn on the <I>Ra</I>-<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.png"
 ALT="$\mathcal A$"> plane by Eckert and Carlson (1961),
based on their experimental results,
gives a one-third power dependence on <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.png"
 ALT="$\mathcal A$">.
Though intermediate, this conclusion must be treated with some
caution, since the sparsity of the experimental data points allowed
Dixon and Probert to draw,  just as plausibly, their vertical line.
