<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>
A mathematical model is developed for stationary nonisothermal unsaturated
vapour transport.  It incorporates the Boussinesq approximation, but includes
the finite mass transfer rate effects of nonzero interfacial velocity and
the enthalpy carried by diffusive fluxes.  It is proved that (under
conditions more general than those assumed in the model) strong
local extrema of temperature or vapour mass fraction are impossible.
The model is used to investigate the effect of finite mass transfer rates
and bounding solid surfaces on vapour transport.

<P>
A solution is presented for the space bounded only by two
parallel plane vertical walls held at different uniform temperatures and vapour 
mass fractions.  This is used to demonstrate many of the basic features of
vapour transport.  In particular, it shows that the total energy
transfer across a cavity may be greatly affected by the enthalpy carried by
vapour.

<P>
Numerical solutions are obtained using the <I>Fastflo</I> finite element package.
These demonstrate the existence of a fully developed region in plane vertical
rectangular cavities with vertical aspect ratios as low as 5.  The criterion
for this is shown to depend on both
the vertical aspect ratio and the combined Grashof number, <!-- MATH
 $\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)$
 -->

 ALT="$\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)$">.

<P>
In many applications, such as those involving humid air at ordinary
temperatures, the mass transfer rates are low.  A simplified but
rational approximation to the model is derived that is valid under these
conditions.  The contribution of vapour gradients to buoyancy forces
and particularly the effect of evaporative cooling must be retained in
this limit.

<P>
The infinite vertical plane cavity solution is extended to horizontally
bounded cavities with 
rectangular or elliptic sections for low mass transfer rates.  It is found
that the flow in the vertical midplane of a tall narrow cuboid
is only effectively two-dimensional
if the span of the cavity is at least 1.7 times its breadth.

<P>
An asymptotic solution, to first order in

 ALT="$\varPhi $">, the mass transfer rate factor,
is presented for spherical cavities.
This follows from a new general solution of the inhomogeneous Stokes
problem in the sphere.
In addition to the primary buoyancy-driven circulation, the solution shows
two secondary flows.  These correspond to the `convective' and `inertial'
mechanisms for three-dimensional flow in a side-heated cuboid identified by
Mallinson and de Vahl Davis (1973, 1977).  The analytical form of the
solution clarifies the nature of these mechanisms.  In particular, it is
shown that the inertial mechanism
vanishes quadratically as the primary flow tends to zero
and also vanishes if the stream-lines are straight.
