Aims and significance</A>
</H1>

<P>
The basic aim of this project is to predict the heat and mass
transfer rates given the temperature and humidity of the cavity walls.
A complete attainment of this aim is still some way off, however,
since convective transport is highly nonlinear and under many commonly
occurring sets of boundary conditions the fluid will be turbulent.
More specifically, then, the first aim of this project is to develop a
consistent mathematical model of the transport processes and identify
the key dimensionless parameters and possible regimes of behaviour of
the system.

<P>
The second aim is to focus on some of these regimes, to model the 
behaviour within them, and to determine
their approximate boundaries in the parameter space.  The purpose of these
simplified models is to provide the functional form for correlations of
results from experiments and numerical solutions.  This is necessary as
the large number of governing dimensionless parameters (nine in the
current model) makes an exhaustive set of either experiments or
numerical solutions prohibitively expensive.

<P>
As well as the fundamental significance of natural convection in the sciences
of heat and mass transfer and fluid mechanics, and the practical and economic
importance of understanding and predicting vapour transmission rates in the
technological applications listed above, the findings of this study have
environmental implications in the context of the thermal design of building
envelopes, particularly in warm humid climates.  Environmental implications are
possible on the individual, regional
 and global levels.  For example, if there is a
high vapour transmission rate through a building wall cavity, this may well
lead to moisture content related deterioration of other parts of the structure
(TenWolde 1989; White 1989) 
while the attendant
large energy transfer rate could significantly affect the comfort of the 
occupant individuals who, in turn, may  go out and buy a large
air-conditioning unit.  This, of course, increases demand for and dependence on
electricity which is supplied either by the damming of natural watercourses
(regional environmental degradation) or
 the carbon dioxide-producing combustion
of fossil fuels, both of which have been associated with global warming.
On the other hand, a
better understanding of the physics of vapour transport could lead to the
design of more energy efficient housing in the tropics. 
As such advances are some way in off in the future,
this project is more about uncovering the basic mechanisms of
vapour transport and describing them in a simple but
hopefully illuminating manner.

<P>
Considering the building wall cavity problem in more detail, the reason for
horizontal vapour transfer can be explained as follows.  Many common wall
materials, such as brick, concrete, wood and plaster are porous and can both
hold and transmit large amounts of moisture
(Close, Suehrcke &amp; Masatto 1995).
 The outside of an external wall
may be exposed to sun and rain.  The vapour pressure exerted by a porous
material increases with both temperature and moisture content, so that the
air in the cavity in contact with the surface of the outer leaf may well be
more humid than that on the inner side.  Given this information, the task is
to investigate how quickly the vapour crosses the cavity and how much
thermal energy it takes with it.

<P>
This project is a fundamental study, and the conclusions to be presented
are of sufficient generality to be relevant to all the applications
listed.  The building wall cavity problem, however, will be kept constantly in
mind as an example and as a guide for selecting, when necessary,
which parts of the parameter space to investigate.
