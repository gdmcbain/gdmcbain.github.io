Inertial generation of spanwise flow
</H2>

<P>
The inertial generation of a spanwise or axial flow by the viscous interaction
of a rotating body of fluid and a perpendicular solid surface occurs in
several areas of fluid mechanics, such as in curved rivers (Thomson 1876, 1877;
Reynolds 1888;
Falc&#243;n 1984;
Johannesson &amp; Parker 1989)
and pipes (Thomson 1876; Eustice 1911; Dean, W. R. 1927;
Patankar, Pratap and Spalding 1974;
Jabbari, Burns &amp; Goldstein 1998).
The phenomenon is utilized in aquaculture to rid tanks of unwanted settleable
solids (Timmons, Summerfelt &amp; Vinci 1998; Peterson 1999).
 Perhaps its most familiar manifestation is the
gathering of tea leaves at the centre of the bottom of the cup on stirring.

<P>
This last quotidian example is quite instructive.  One immediately notices
that the tea leaves travel radially inward along the bottom and begin to rise
along the axis regardless of whether the tea is stirred clockwise or
anticlockwise; i.e. the secondary flow is independent of the sign of the
rotational speed, <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img114.png"
 ALT="$\varOmega $">, of the stirring.  This implies
that the axial component of velocity at any point on the axis near the base
must be an even function of <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img114.png"
 ALT="$\varOmega $">.  Assuming that for
sufficiently slow stirring, i.e. small Reynolds number

can be expanded in a power series, it
will only contain the terms involving even powers of <IMG

It is obvious that the coefficient of <IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1014.png"
 ALT="$\varOmega ^0$"> must vanish, since there
is no secondary flow without the primary flow, so that the first term is
quadratic.  The immediate conclusion is that there is no secondary
flow in the creeping flow limit (<!-- MATH
 $\mathit{Re}\rightarrow 0$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\mathit{Re}\rightarrow 0$">).  The
corresponding dimensionless axial velocity, <!-- MATH

<IMG

 ALT="$w_*/\varOmega b$">,
will be an odd function of <IMG

 SRC="img63.png"
 ALT="$\mathit{Re}$">.

<P>
The earliest scientific description of this general phenomenon seems to be
Stokes's (1845). Of the motion of fluid between
concentric coaxially rotating spheres (spherical Couette flow), he noted that
motion in circular stream-lines about the axis of rotation was impossible
unless the centrifugal force were neglected, whereas if it were included:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
it is easy to see that from the excess of centrifugal force in the
neighbourhood of the equator of the [inner] revolving sphere the particles in
that part will recede from the sphere, and approach it again in the
neighbourhood of the poles, and this circulating motion will be combined with
a motion about the axis. (Stokes 1845)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Spherical Couette flow was later studied by Lamb (1932, p.&nbsp;588), who gave the
creeping flow limiting solution, and Munson and Joseph (1971),
who presented results from an asymptotic expansion for low
Reynolds number indicating the correctness of Stokes's and Lamb's
predictions; in particular, the expansion for the motion in meridian planes
involves only odd powers of the Reynolds number.
There are also several recent numerical studies
(Schwengels &amp; Schulz 1989; Riad Mossad 1993; Ni &amp; Nigro 1994;
Nakabayashi &amp; Tsuchida 1995; Zikanov 1996).

<P>
If the entire boundary of a fluid were
rotating, the fluid, at steady state, would rotate as a solid body (Rayleigh
1913),
in which case the effect of the centrifugal force would be to generate a
pressure varying as the square of the azimuthal velocity 
(Lamb 1932, p.&nbsp;28; Bird et al. 1960, pp.&nbsp;96-8).
With one end-wall fixed, the azimuthal velocity (and therefore the centrifugal
force and consequent pressure) must vary axially.  It is this axial
variation in pressure which gives rise to the axial velocity.  Now, the
centrifugal force is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature
of the azimuthal velocity.  In the rotating cylinder this is simply
equal to the distance from the axis, but if an analogy is drawn between
Pao's problem and the buoyant flow in a cavity this need not be so.  For
a unicellular flow in a very tall cavity, the stream-lines sufficiently
far from the horizontal surfaces will be practically straight, so that
their radius of curvature is infinite and the centrifugal force vanishes.
There is, therefore, no centrifugally generated pressure, no axial
variation of centrifugally generated pressure and no force to cause
axial/spanwise flow.

<P>
Of course, the temperature will also be independent of <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img84.png"
 ALT="$z$"> in the fully
developed region so that the first (thermal) mechanism is eliminated too.

<P>
The centrifugal force is proportional to the square of the
azimuthal velocity, and therefore must vanish faster than the primary
circulating flow as the speed scale, <!-- MATH
 $\nu\mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)/b$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img625.png"
 ALT="$\nu \mbox{\textit{Gr}}(1+N)/b$">, tends to zero.  
Thus, the second
(inertial) mechanism for spanwise flow in a confined convective roll vanishes
if either the stream-lines are straight or terms quadratic in the
velocity vanish (creeping flow).
