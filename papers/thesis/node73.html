Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter I have presented the fully developed profiles of
temperature, mass fraction and velocity, and the consequent mass and
energy fluxes at the vertical walls, in the space between two
parallel walls at different but constant conditions
for a perfect Boussinesq mixture of a gas and a vapour
with constant properties except for the mixture specific heat.  The
finite mass transfer effects of interfacial velocity and the
interdiffusion of enthalpy were included.

<P>
The governing equations were obtained from those for a cuboid
by taking the limit as the vertical and spanwise
aspect ratios tended to infinity.  In
this process, the vertical and spanwise
gradients of all dependent variables 
dropped out of the field equations (apart from a uniform vertical pressure
gradient).
As a consequence, the
boundary conditions at the other surfaces
had to be abandoned.  The solutions
presented thus apply equally well to flow in open channels as well as
cavities, but only sufficiently far from the ends.  The question of how
far is sufficiently far must await the solution for the flow in the end
regions, which will be treated in chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node74.html#ch:FC">5</A> and <A HREF="node101.html#ch:BS">7</A>.

<P>
In the zero mass transfer limit, the temperature and mass fraction vary
linearly across the cavity while the horizontal velocity is zero and the
vertical velocity is described by a cubic (odd symmetric for a cavity,
and tending toward an even symmetric parabola as the imposed pressure
gradient becomes large compared to the density perturbation for an open
channel).  For finite mass transfer, the horizontal velocity is nonzero,
but must be
constant.  This horizontal advection profoundly alters the transport of
vapour, energy and momentum across the cavity, so that while their
profiles can still be expressed in closed form, this involves
exponential functions rather than polynomials.  The expression derived
for the wall energy flux shows that the overall cavity energy transfer
can be very much higher if a vapour condenses at the walls.
