<P></P>
<P>This paper presents a review of water sorption by cellulose, often referred to as
hygroscopic or Brix-free water.  Of particular interest is the apparent dependence of
hygroscopic water on interparticulate ('effective') stress.  The analysis suggests that the
level of 25% currently assumed in the Australian industry is reasonable at low fibre
compactions but at high compactions a much lower value, approximately 8%, may be more
appropriate.  It is hypothesised that a link exists between cell wall collapse and the
reduction of hygroscopic water with increasing effective stress.  It is concluded that
hygroscopic water must be defined in terms of temperature, solution concentration, (vapour
or) pore pressure and effective stress in the fibre skeleton.</P>

<P><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P>The preferential affinity of sugar cane cellulose for water has been know more than a
century (Bruyn 1963).  This affinity for water reduces the capacity of mill rolls to dewater
sugar cane fibre and, to a certain extent, works in the millers favour by preferentially
rejecting sucrose.  The proportion of this 'hygroscopic', or Brix-free, water in cane is also
of interest in making a judgement on whether it should be included as liquid or solid in
numerical simulation of the rolling process (Downing et al. 1999).  More recently, there
has been discussion on the dependence of hygroscopic water on the interparticulate
'effective' stress carried by the fibre matrix during crushing (Murry et al. 1998).</P>
<P></P>
<P>There have been numerous experiments evaluating hygroscopic water, conducted by
various authors using a range of experimental techniques.  The two principle methods used
have been:  (a) vapour sorption, where water is sorbed by dry sugar-free cane fibre from a
controlled atmosphere;  and, (b) contacting solution, where dry sugar-free cane fibre is
placed in a sucrose (or other) solution of known concentration, allowed to equilibrate and
the hygroscopic water calculated from the change in solution concentration.  Since a small
quantity of sucrose may be sorbed by the fibre in addition to the water, the latter method
measures the differential sorption of water over sucrose (Kelly and Rutherford 1957).  This
paper reviews the mechanisms of sorption, the sugar literature and the apparent dependence
of hygroscopic water on stress in the fibre skeleton.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Sorption of water by cellulose</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P>The term sorption, coined by J.W. McBain (1909), denotes the uptake of a vapour (or
liquid) by a solid.  It may be classified as adsorption or absorption depending on whether
the uptake is superficial or volumetric.  The two processes often occur together, but over
different time-scales.  A secondary classification may be made, although only
quantitatively, according to the nature of the bonds involved--physical or chemical--these
being distinguishable macroscopically by the magnitude of the heat of sorption.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Coulson et al. (1996) describe adsorption as occurring in three stages:  a single layer of
molecules (a monolayer) builds up over the surface of the solid by adsorption or
chemisorption;  if fluid concentrations are high enough, further layers (multilayers) may
form by adsorption to the limit of the mesopore size (250 nm); and, finally, for adsorption
from the gaseous phase, capillary condensation may occur when the partial pressure of the
adsorbate reaches a critical value relative to mesopore size.  Since mesopore size may vary
significantly in a given solid, all three stages may be occurring simultaneously. The mass
transfer rate, to the multilayer, depends upon the surface area of the solid and the
concentration difference across the multilayer. Several theories have been developed to
quantify gassolid adsorption, including BET theory, Gibbs adsorption isotherm, and
potential theory.  These theories are covered in some detail in texts such as Coulson et al.
(1996).  In principle, the equations derived for gassolid systems are applicable to
liquidsolid systems, excepting capillary condensation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Following Valko (1943), the usual method of correlating sorption data is to plot moisture
content against the vapour pressure of the liquid in the surrounding atmosphere or, more
conveniently, against relative humidity (RH) where RH is the ratio of the vapour pressure
of the liquid to the corresponding saturation vapour pressure at that temperature (eg. Figure
1).  The adsorption and desorption data for cellulose together form a sorption loop, i.e. a
pair of BET Type II multilayer isotherms.  Adamson (1982) explains:  the first section of
the Type II isotherm, up to the 'knee', corresponds to monolayer formation;  the
intermediate region indicates multilayer build-up;  and, the apparent infinite film thickness
at high relative humidities (asymptotic section) indicates interparticle, or capillary,
condensation.  The difference between adsorption and desorption curves occurs due to
hysteresis effects which are not explained by BET theory.  Hysteresis possibly arises from
changes in the radii of the contacting liquid or the relative amounts of crystalline and
amorphous cellulose material making up natural cellulose.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Water vapour sorption loops for some cellulosic materials are illustrated in Figure 1.  The
sorption curves for wood are noticeably higher than those for cotton cellulose.  The
adsorption curve for Q50 sugar cane (Foster 1956) is similar to bleached sulphite pulp. 
Cotton fibres freshly removed from the seed are noted to yield sorption isotherms which
lay well above the standard cellulose sorption loops presented in the figure (Valko 1943). 
Collectively, the isotherms suggest monolayer water of about 36% sorbed water percent
dry weight and multilayer water perhaps up to 10% or more.  Keey (1996) quoted a
monomolecular adsorption figure of 8%, at 25<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>C for softwood, which is consistent with the
8% hygroscopic water for pure cellulose powder determined using the solution contact
method (Kelly and Rutherford 1957; van der Pol, Young and Douwes-Dekker 1957).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Valko (1943) discussed the work of several authors on the subject of water take up by
cellulose and the net contraction of the adsorbed water, including a number of x-ray
diffraction studies.  Using x-ray diffraction it has been determined that cellulose crystalline
regions do not expand and, therefore, do not absorb water between the molecules.  The
crystalline regions may, however, build up a multilayer on the surface of the<EM> crystallites</EM>. 
Amorphous cellulose regions, where intermolecular cohesion is lower, preferentially sorb
water.  Variation in crystallinity, therefore, affects the ability of the cellulose to sorb water. 
</P>
<P></P>
<P>When water is sorbed by cellulose, the cellulose swells but careful examination shows that
the expanded volume is less than the sum of the component volumes.  X-ray diffraction
analysis and fibre density measurements in helium have demonstrated that it is the water
volume which contracts.  Valko (1943) concluded that the first layer of sorbed water
undergoes strong contraction and that the degree of contraction decreases for subsequent
layers.  The contraction effect is clearly demonstrated in Figure 2 where the density of the
rigidly bound (ice-like) first layer of water is calculated to be 2.60 g/ml.  The apparent
density decreases to about 1 g/ml at a moisture content of 89%, at this stage the adsorbed
water is liquid-like.  Valko quoted the pressure required to achieve the apparent density of
the first sorbed water at 1400 MPa and the average pressure for the entire multilayer at
200 MPa.  Valko suggested that the distinction between free and sorbed water is not sharp; 
rather, there is graduated influence of the cellulose on the whole of the<EM> swelling water.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P>The difference between vapour phase adsorption and the contacting solution method is
somewhat indistinct.  During sorption from vapour, there is a replacement of hydrogen
bonds between fibrefibre molecules by bonds between water and fibre molecules.  In the
case of fibre swelling in a contacting solution, some waterwater and cellulosecellulose
hydrogen bonds are replaced with watercellulose bonds, the cohesion forces overcome by
solvation forces.  The two techniques may differ due to the contribution of capillary
condensation;  however, condensation of water in preformed spaces within dry fibres is not
expected to be more than 23% mass on cellulose, based on microscopic cross-section
measurements and x-ray determinations of the unit cell (Valko 1943).  Further, Stamm
(1997) states that dry cell walls are virtually free of voids that could fill with water
without swelling (absorption) occurring.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sorption of water by sugar cane fibre</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Vapour Sorption.  </STRONG>Foster (1962) stated that the chemical and physical structure of the
thick walled fibre cells of sugar cane are similar to those of wood fibre.  Not all the
cellular material in sugar cane is cellulose, sugar cane also contains 1721% lignin
(Brotherton 1985).  Foster (1962) conducted vapour sorption experiments on predried Q50
cane fibre at 20<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>C for 3595% RH (Figure 1).  He subsequently extrapolated his results to
100% RH and quoted a figure of 25% for hygroscopic water.  The extrapolation was into
the section of the isotherm where it is almost parallel with the ordinate axis and difficult to
justify.  Kelly (1957) also conducted vapour sorption measurements at 27.2<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>C and
determined a value of 35% hygroscopic water at 100% RH.  In the face of uncertainty
regarding maximum water take-up in a saturated atmosphere, a standard value of 25% has
been adopted by the Australian sugar industry.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Contacting Solution.  </STRONG>The more common approach for determining hygroscopic water on
sugar cane fibre is the solution contact method (Murry et al. 1998; Kelly and Rutherford
1957; van der Pol et al. 1957; Foster 1962; Steuerwald 1912; Qin and White 1991;
Mangion and Player 1991).  A review of the results obtained using this method follows.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Steuerwald (1912) determined a value of 22.4% for hygroscopic water, using the solution
contact method.  Steuerwald also used a pressing technique where pure sucrose solution
was added to 'fresh' cane fibre and pressed to obtain a residue.  Following this method
hygroscopic water was found to decrease to 16.5% as applied pressure was increased to 30
MPa.  Foster (1962) initially attributed the decrease to variation in Brix in the stalk, in
particular, to <EM>fibrovascular water</EM>. Fibrovascular water is the very low Brix (&lt; 0.8)
solutions in the large vessels (in xylem), sieve tubes (in phloem) and fibre lumen that
make up the vascular bundles.  The fibrovascular water amounts to approximately 3% of
the weight of cane and is in relatively large cavities.  The water in the large vessels and
sieve tubes of the fibrovascular bundles is relatively easily removed (Douwes-Dekker
1961);  however, the low sugar liquid in the thick-walled shorter tissues surrounding these
elements is much more strongly held (Foster 1956).  After conducting press tests, Foster
(1962) concluded that there is some variation in hygroscopic water due to expression. 
Foster reports: hygroscopic water on bagasse at 10.8% by Brix balance, corresponding to
18.4% by Pol balance; and, 9.013.8% on prepared cane fibre at 40 MPa.  Foster also
notes that increasing the sucrose concentration reduces sorbed water due to increased
affinity of the sucrose for water molecules.  The pressure dependency of hygroscopic water
is also reported for cotton (Valko 1943).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Mangion and Player (1991) investigated varietal and location effects on hygroscopic water
using 10<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT> Brix solution and found:  an average hygroscopic water level of 20.6% with a
standard deviation of 2.2 units for 250 data points; a small spread in hygroscopic water for
six varieties, 17.020.3%; tops/green leaf had a slightly higher hygroscopic water,
23.524.1%; trash and stalk both had similar levels of hygroscopic water; a much lower
hygroscopic water level was observed for roots, 4.56.7%; and, growing location did not
consistently affect hygroscopic water.  Mangion and Player also developed a Soxhlet
extraction technique for determining hygroscopic water on cane fibre.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A much stronger varietal effect was found by Kelly and Rutherford (1957); i.e., Q50
adsorbed approximately twice the water that three other varieties sorbed.  Van der Pol et
al. (1957)  determined that fibre and leaf both sorbed an average of 29% hygroscopic
water when in contact with 20<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT> Brix solution after the fibre samples has been dried at
various temperatures.  Interestingly,  van der Pol et al. point out that the fibre retained 5%
water after cold extraction at 60<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>C in the presence of P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, the last remaining water
appearing to be tightly bound.  In both articles, pure cellulose powder was tested as a
reference material and the adsorbed water value was reported to be 8%.  It is not specified
in either article how the cellulose had been prepared.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Qin and White (1991) report on the development of a variation to the solution contact
method where smaller volumes of solution are added to the fibre specimen; i.e., solution to
fibre ratios closer to three than the traditional 20.  The specimen and solution are
repeatedly pressed, giving improved mixing and increased accuracy.  For a 5<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>Brix solution
at room temperature, the hygroscopic water is determined for rind 11.9%, fibrovascular
bundles 18.3% and pith 22.1%.  The decrease in hygroscopic water from pith to
fibrovascular bundles to rind to root is thought to be due to increasing cell wall thickness,
i.e. less available surface area (decreasing specific surface) for adsorption of nonsolvent
water, and change in the cell wall material, particularly lignification.  The hygroscopic
water values appeared to be independent of temperature effects over the range 1555<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>C;
however, this maybe due to the limited amount of data available.  Valko (1943) and
Nelson (1983) both report that increasing temperature reduces vapour sorption up to 85%
RH, beyond which point the effect of temperature is not consistent.</P>
<P></P>
<P>On reviewing the work of Munro (1964), Murry (1997) determined that hygroscopic water
as a mass fraction on fibre, <EM>H<SUB>w</SUB></EM><SUB></SUB>, appeared to decrease both with increasing preparation and
increasing Brix extraction (i.e. increasing compression pressures 055 MPa).  There is a
possible error in this observation due to the potential inclusion of low Brix fibrovascular
water.  There are also conflicting reports of the effect of beating on the equilibrium
moisture content of paper:  Valko (1943) states that the beating of pulp has no effect on
the hygroscopic water, while Higham (1968) states that there is an increase in equilibrium
water with beating (the consistency of the definitions 'hygroscopic' and 'equilibrium' has
not been confirmed).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Subsequently, Murry et al. (1998) reported experiments at controlled pressures using the
solutionpress apparatus developed by Qin and White (1991).  The results of the latter
tests show a clear decrease in hygroscopic water with increasing compaction; there is also
a suggestion that below compactions of 300 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP> hygroscopic water averaged
approximately 22% and above compactions of 400 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP> averaged 7.5%.  During these
tests (Khatri 1997), a bagasse density of 450 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP> was achieved at pressures of 27 MPa
with corresponding hygroscopic water levels of 79% (note, much higher compactions
would normally be expected at this pressure).  Murry et al. correlated their data using
linear and sigmoidal curve fits.  The sigmoidal regression captures the perceived step
change in hygroscopic water.  No explanation for the change in hygroscopic behaviour was
offered.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In summary, hygroscopic water in sugar cane:</P>
<P></P>
<P>		a.	decreases with increasing concentration of the contacting solution, but is
independent of the juicefibre ratio used (Qin and White 1991);</P>
<P>		b.	depends on cane variety (Kelly and Rutherford 1957; Mangion and Player 1991);</P>
<P>		c.	has a mean value of 20.6% by contacting solution at 10Bx, pressure unspecified
(Mangion and Player 1991);</P>
<P>		d.	depends on the portion of fibre being tested, i.e. rind 11.9%, fibrovascular bundles
18.3%, pith 22.1% and root 4.56.7% (Qin and White 1991; Mangion and Player
1991);</P>
<P>		e.	may decrease with comminution (possible error due to the potential inclusion of
fibrovascular water) (Murry 1997); </P>
<P>		f.	depends on pressure applied to fibre matrix, reducing to 16.5% at 30 MPa
(Steuerwald 1912), 9.013.8% at 40 MPa (Foster 1962), to 79% at 27 MPa (Khatri
1997);</P>
<P>		g.	appears independent of temperature under fully saturated conditions, 1555<FONT FACE="Bitstream Arrus"></FONT>C (Qin
and White 1991);  and</P>
<P>		h.	is independent of growing locality (Mangion and Player 1991).</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Apparent dependence of hygroscopic water on fibre effective stress</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P>References to the pressure dependence of hygroscopic water will now be considered in
detail.  It is also important to distinguish between vapour or pore (hydraulic) pressure, and
the interparticulate effective stress in the fibre skeleton.  A load very slowly applied to a
(wet) specimen by a platen or plunger will allow pore pressure to abate leaving the fibre
skeleton to carry the entire platen load.  A specimen held at a constant volume achieves
the same type of pore pressurefree, effective stress state with time.  The reported effective
stress dependence of hygroscopic water is a concern for milling engineers who routinely
monitor the extraction and dewatering performance of their mills.  A decrease in
hygroscopic water at mill pressures implies that the Brix may be mixed with a larger
volume of water than expected and, therefore, be more difficult to extract.  Lower
hygroscopic water also implies that dewatering performance is far worse than it should be; 
i.e., the proportion of<EM> fixed</EM> water in the bagasse is lower and there is more <EM>free</EM> water
available for expression.  If a definition for hygroscopic water including 'pressure' or fibre
effective stress is to be used, then a much smaller value than the Australian industry
standard value of 25% should be used.  How much smaller should the hygroscopic water
value be and why is hygroscopic water pressure dependent?</P>
<P></P>
<P>During milling the fibre skeleton experiences stresses exceeding 20 MPa (Murry and Holt
1967).  As stated above, the apparent density of the first sorbed water is 1400 MPa and the
average pressure for the entire multilayer (89% water, Figure 2) is 200 MPa.  It is
unlikely that the pressures applied during milling would affect the multilayer water to any
great extent and a logical lower limit of 8% is established for hygroscopic water.  Given
the 200 MPa average pressure in the bound layers, it may be inferred that effective stress
in the fibre skeleton at milling pressures is carried through the bound liquid film directly. 
This conclusion does not negate the principle of effective stress but does discount direct
point contact between solid cellulose particles.  If the upper limit to hygroscopic water at
10?Bx is taken to be 20.6%, assuming a small unstated stress level (Mangion and Player
1991); then, between the upper and lower limits, hygroscopic water must be defined in
terms of temperature, solution concentration, (vapour or) pore pressure and effective stress
in the fibre skeleton.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To understand why hygroscopic water is pressure dependent, a mechanistic approach is
adopted.  Consider the elastic moduli of sugar cane fibre, 8.3 GPa (Pidduck 1955) and
cellulose, 25 GPa (Downing et al. 1999).  At pressures of 20 MPa the strain in the
cellulose material is quite small (approximately 0.001) and would not be expected to affect
the mesopore volume or absorbed water.  The 20 MPa pressure is, however, high enough
to compact bagacillo platelets into close proximity and to elastically or plastically collapse
many of the cell walls of the fibrovascular bundles bringing cell wall faces into contact. 
When the cellbagacillo surfaces come into contact there is a reduction in exposed surface
area and, it is speculated, loosely bound water may be displaced.  The displacement of
loosely bound fluid results in an apparent  decrease in the hygroscopic water.  The
decrease in hygroscopic water is likely to depend upon:  the particleparticle contact
pressure;  the flexibility of the cell wall material, hence elastic and plastic collapsing
stresses;  the surface areas in contact and voids ratio;  the curvatures of the surfaces;  the
roughness of the cellulose;  the apparent viscosity of the film;  and, capillary pressure as
the two surfaces approach.  In reality, the loosely bound water is probably not a
continuous film and the reduction in sorbed water is more likely to be the result of a
decrease in 'shared' hygroscopic water volume as the cellulose particles approach one
another.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It is hypothesised that a link exists between cell wall collapse, where collapsing stresses
increase with increasing cell wall thickness and reducing cell wall length (refer to honeycomb
model presented by Downing et al. 1999), and the variation in hygroscopic water, from
nominally 2025% down to 8%, with increasing compression pressure.  Since the hypothesis
is based on the physical response of the cell walls, it stands to reason that the expulsion of
loosely bound hygroscopic water would be reversible within the capacity of the cell walls to
recover elastically, or viscoelastically, from the deformation.  Due to the high degree of scatter
in the hygroscopic watercompaction data (Murry et al. 1998), it is not possible to confirm
the suitability of a cellular collapse model for the hygroscopic behaviour and the hygroscopic
watercompaction tests should be repeated on a larger scale.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The implications of a low (8%) hygroscopic water value on related matters, such as the cane
payment formula,  have not been considered at this point in time.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P>A review of the literature has demonstrated that sorbed water is bound to cellulose fibre with
a varying degree of attraction.  Total bound water may be as high as 35% (Kelly 1957); 
however, the firmly bound multilayer water is limited to about 8% on fibre dry weight,
corresponding to approximately 1% of the total cane mass and a little over 1% of the total
liquid phase in cane.  This small liquid fraction may be included as free liquid in numerical
models of the rolling process (Downing et al. 1999).</P>
<P></P>
<P>The reduction in hygroscopic water with increasing effective stress in the solid phase is
perceived to be an effect caused by the displacement of loosely bound water as fibre particles
approach.  It is hypothesised that a link exists between cell wall collapse, where collapsing
stresses increase with increasing cell wall thickness and reducing cell wall length, and the
reduction in hygroscopic water from nominally 2025% down to 8% with increasing
compression pressure.  Recent work by Murry et al. (1998), however, shows too much scatter
to conclusively demonstrate the hypothesis using a cellular collapse model (Downing et al.
1999)<SUP> </SUP>and the experiments should be repeated on a larger scale.  Further, it is clear that
hygroscopic water must now be defined in terms of temperature, solution concentration,
(vapour or) pore pressure and effective stress in the fibre skeleton.</P>
